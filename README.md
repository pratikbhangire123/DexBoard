Tech Stack
----------
Tools-
1. Covalent API
2. Next.js/ReactJS
3. Chart.js
4. VS Code

Programming Languages-
1. JavaScript
2. CSS
3. HTML

Covalent API
------------

The soul of this project is Data. And hence it is very important to have a fast, secure, reliable, and easy-to-use tool to provide on-chain data.

And, Covalent API's endpoints does this job perfectly by making data fetching the easiest task of this entire project.

I have used the Covalent's Class B (XY = K) and Pricing endpoints such as,

1. DEX Health & Ecosystem Data
2. Pools & Tokens
3. Token Transactions
4. Historical Token Prices

Next.js/ReactJS
---------------

It's not just about having the data, it is also about how to access and represent it.

And, that's why I choose Next.js to leverage its automatic Routing, In-built-CSS, Optimized Components, and other great features.

Chart.js
--------

Building a dashboard needs to have some awesome charts to represent the data visually.

And, I used a simple, lightweight, and flexible JavaScript library called Chart.js to create awesome charts in my project.   


Results
-------
1. Include DEXes on Ethereum Blockchain
2. Overview Page for Ecosystem Data
3. Pools Page for Pools Related Data
4. Tokens Page for Token Related Data
5. Token Explorer Page for Analyzing Token in More Detail
